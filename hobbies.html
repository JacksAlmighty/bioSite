      <h2>What I Enjoy Doing</h2>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects, gaming with friends, working on my car, and listening to music. I also like exploring new tech tools and learning how they work. I spend a lot of time experimenting with different coding ideas or trying to improve my projects, whether itâ€™s building something new or fixing small details. Working on my car helps me relax and gives me a hands-on way to problem-solve, while gaming and music help me unwind and stay connected with friends. I enjoy finding a balance between creativity, learning, and having fun in everything I do.</p>

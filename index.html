        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Jackson Webster</strong>. Welcome to my personal website! This site is part of my CSD 340 Web Development class, where I’m learning how to create well-structured and visually appealing web pages using HTML, CSS, and modern design practices.</p>
        <p>On this website, I share a bit about my hobbies, personal projects, and goals. My aim is to show how creativity and technical skills can combine to produce interactive websites that are both functional and fun to explore. From coding small web apps to building custom PCs, I enjoy challenging myself and learning every day.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the About and Hobbies pages to learn more about my projects, interests, and personal journey.</p>
